Welcome sarahliz24,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!

# INTRODUCTION

This application is developed to assist a manager in a busy clinical hospital environment.  Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a highly skilled discpline.  in a busy Radiotherapy department it can be difficult to ensure enough staff are trained in the various sub-techniques of SRS, and to track who is trained in which area.  Along with this difficulty there can be frequesnt challenges maintaining a suitable staff base to deliver treatment, particular due to factors such as covid, high staff turnover, and other unexpected staffing shortages.  This app is designed to record the training of each applicable staff member in each or any SRS module they are trained in.  This can actd a training record for each staff member.  This can also function as a tool for the person managing the skill mix of the department - if there is a roster shortage the user can search the app for available staff members to see if their obtained skills match the need for the day, search by staff member to see if an available staff member has the required skills, or simply display a full talbe showing all skills and all staff recorded as having those skills.  This can help to improve staffing decisions by providing the information in a clear manner and reduce stress as managers don't have to recall what each staff member is ablt to do...
